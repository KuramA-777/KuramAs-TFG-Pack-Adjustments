This is a update Pack i made for the Modpack -> https://github.com/TerraFirmaGreg-Team/Modpack-Modern

I made a bunch of adjustments like recipe balance and new ones to fit my enjoyment and make it less obnoxious in some places, or even add more functions and ability to automate later with GT, also a new Multiblock for infinite Oregen at around IV stage of GT with some restricitions and cost to it.

Also added my resource packs i use and adjusted Shaderpacks so they work with TFC

Useful spreadsheet for where to find ores in this pack -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P3Baz4y5vgJ3XrCoNs4l3BXGPiFEPlW7i4taPEWpTB4/edit?gid=0#gid=0

To install this you use the function of "Update from file" inside Prism (i dont know if other launchers have this aswell) after you installed the regular TFG Modern modpack, the mentioned function is in the Curseforge Tab when you right click the instance and click edit.

This is a update Pack i made for the Modpack -> https://github.com/TerraFirmaGreg-Team/Modpack-Modern

I made a bunch of adjustments like recipe balance and new ones to fit my enjoyment and make it less obnoxious in some places, or even add more functions and ability to automate later with GT, also a new Multiblock for infinite Oregen at around IV stage of GT with some restricitions and cost to it.

Also added my resource packs i use and adjusted Shaderpacks so they work with TFC
